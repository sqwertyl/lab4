Part 1:

Exercise 1:
The command searches recursively through all directories from the current one, and finds all instances of the term "smutex" in each file.

./sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void scond_signal(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
./sthread.cpp:void scond_broadcast(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
...


Exercise 2:
You can use `grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp` to look for these objects, though it will also return things that have the word Task in them but not only that.
`grep "return" *.h`


Exercise 3:
The lines returned by this are all function calls pertaining to smutex (and any parameters that are included). This can tell me where these specific functions are called.


Exercise 4:
This opens the file "blkdev.h" located in `include/linux`


Exercise 5: 
It is located in the file "futex.c" in the folder `kernel` on line 188. It describes a struct that manages "priority inheritance".


Exercise 6: 
There are three functions located in `kernel/sched/auto_group.c` (line 231) and `kernel/sched/debug.c` (555, 662).


Exercise 7: 
There are 3907 header files.


Part 2:
(Exercise 8 is a coding exercise)


Exercise 9:
The error was on line 12 of file "linked_list.c". It was originally a do-while loop which would error if the list was empty originally. The fix was just making it a regular while loop.


Exercise 10:
16


Exercise 11:
P_EMPTY


Exercise 12:
It executes the default case.


(Exercise 13 is a coding exercise)



Part 3:

Exercise 14:
The name of the scheduling algorithm is: round robin


(Exercise 15 is a coding exercise)


Exercise 16:
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1280ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800ms

Average response time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5ms
Average response time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480ms


Exercise 17:
Did you complete Exercise 17A, Exercise 17B, or both?
I did Exercise 17A.


Exercise 18:
It started on process 1, we see that it is the first process to get skipped.


(Exercise 19 is a coding exercise)
